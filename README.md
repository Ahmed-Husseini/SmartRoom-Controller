Smart Room Climate Monitoring and Fan Control System with ESP32
This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller connected to a mobile dashboard to monitor and control the room's climate in real time. It displays live temperature and humidity readings, and controls cooling fans via the MQTT protocol. Users can operate the fans manually or enable an automatic mode that activates them when the temperature or humidity exceeds predefined thresholds.
